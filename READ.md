# mAgents

A project to automate mpesa agents' transaction records in a mAgent system upon a customer making a deposit or a withdrawal transaction. This is meant to eliminate the manual ways of keeping records and hence enhance fast TAT in serving other customers who could have lined up for the similar services.
The project is developed using the JHipster generator with Springboot framework preffered for backend and AngularJS flavor adopted for the frontend development while MongoDb is used as the databrain.
